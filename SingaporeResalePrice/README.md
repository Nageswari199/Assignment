Singapore's Housing Development Board (HDB) plays a crucial role in providing affordable housing for Singaporeans. The HDB resale market is a dynamic and complex environment, with prices influenced by various factors. Data science can be applied to analyze HDB resale data and gain insights into market trends, price determinants, and potential investment opportunities.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
The first step in applying data science to HDB resale data is to collect and prepare the data. Data sources include the HDB Resale Portal, which provides historical transaction data, and data.gov.sg, which offers various datasets related to Singapore's housing market. The collected data needs to be cleaned, processed, and transformed into a format suitable for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves visualizing and summarizing the data to understand its characteristics, patterns, and trends. This helps in identifying potential outliers, missing values, and relationships between variables. EDA techniques like histograms, scatter plots, and box plots can provide valuable insights into the distribution of prices, floor areas, lease lengths, and other key factors.

Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is the process of transforming raw data into features that are more informative and suitable for modeling. This may involve creating new features, combining existing features, or encoding categorical variables. For instance, factors like distance to MRT stations, proximity to amenities, and town popularity can be derived from raw data and used as features in predictive models.

Machine Learning for Price Prediction
Machine learning algorithms can be employed to build models that predict HDB resale prices. Popular algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines. These models are trained on historical data, and their performance is evaluated using metrics like mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).

Factors Affecting HDB Resale Prices
Several factors influence HDB resale prices, including:

Flat attributes: Floor area, room type, remaining lease period, storey level, and flat model

Location: Proximity to MRT stations, bus stops, amenities, and town centers

Market conditions: Overall supply and demand, economic factors, and government policies

Time: Prices tend to increase over time due to urbanization and demand growth

Applications of Data Science in HDB Resale Market
Data science can be applied to various aspects of the HDB resale market:

Price prediction: Developing models to forecast future resale prices, aiding buyers and sellers in making informed decisions

Market analysis: Identifying trends and patterns in price movements, transaction volume, and buyer preferences

Investment analysis: Assessing potential returns on HDB resale investments and identifying undervalued properties

Policy evaluation: Analyzing the impact of government policies on HDB resale prices and market dynamics

Steps:
Load HDB resale data from a CSV file
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize and visualize the data
Create a new feature called 'distance_to_mrt' that represents the distance of each property to the nearest MRT station
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train a regression model using the training data
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data
Predict the resale price for a specific property using the trained model

Data Cleaning Process:
Data cleaning is an essential step in the data preprocessing pipeline, especially for datasets like HDB resale data, which may contain missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. Proper data cleaning ensures the reliability and accuracy of downstream analyses, such as exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling.

Key Steps in Data Cleaning for HDB Resale Data:

Identify Missing Values: Check for missing values in all variables using functions like isnull() or isna(). Examine the extent of missingness and determine the appropriate handling method, such as imputation or removal.

Handle Missing Values: For numerical variables, consider imputation techniques like mean or median imputation. For categorical variables, consider mode imputation or encoding missing values as a separate category.

Detect and Remove Duplicates: Identify duplicate rows using functions like duplicated() and drop_duplicates() to remove redundant entries and ensure data integrity.

Check for Data Type Inconsistencies: Verify that variables have the expected data types. For instance, ensure dates are in a consistent format and numerical variables are of the correct type (integer, float).

Address Outliers and Inconsistencies: Identify and examine outliers using techniques like boxplots and z-scores. Consider removing outliers if they deviate significantly from the overall distribution and are not representative of the data.

Handle Inappropriate Values: Check for values that fall outside of the expected range or violate domain knowledge. For example, ensure resale prices are positive and within a reasonable range for the corresponding floor area, town, and remaining lease.

Standardize Data Formats: Ensure consistent data formats across variables, such as using standard date formats, consistent units of measurement, and appropriate naming conventions.

Document Cleaning Process: Maintain detailed documentation of the data cleaning steps, including the methods used to handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and data inconsistencies. This documentation aids in future data usage and understanding.
